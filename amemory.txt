"Zack! Hello, it's been too long."
"Yes, we should hang out sometime next week if you're free."
"That sounds excellent. I do enjoy you."
"Wednesdays and Thursdays are typically the worst days for me..."
-- (Brain-Consider Monday & Tuesday = best vs. Wednesday Thursday Worst)
"That's perfect. I already have a date on Wednesday..."
"...well, it's not really a date... more of an engagement"
*audienceFace.DisplayEmotion("Surprise")
"An engagement?!"
"No no, not an engagement: more like an arrangement. An appointment.”
My apologies, I was attempting to de-escalate rather than escalate."
"Interesting example of how language works."
"Good example of why I enjoy you.”
